🌍 Live Currency Converter – HTML, CSS, JavaScript
🎓 Project 08 – Completed during my internship at StaxTech

This is a visually appealing, real-time Currency Converter Web Application built using HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism Design) and Vanilla JavaScript, allowing users to convert between global currencies using live exchange rates from an external API. The UI is responsive and user-friendly, with interactive elements like flag previews, currency swap, and animated transitions.
